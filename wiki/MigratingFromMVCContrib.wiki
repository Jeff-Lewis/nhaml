#summary How to migrate to NHaml's built-in MVC View Engine (James Avery)

To upgrade from the MvcContrib version of NHaml:

 # Remove references to MvcContrib and the NHamlViewEngine
 # Add a reference to NHaml.dll and NHaml.Web.MVC.dll
 # In your global.asax add a using statement for NHaml.Web.MVC
 # The same factory setting will work:
  {{{ 
  ControllerBuilder.Current.SetControllerFactory(typeof(NHamlControllerFactory));
  }}}
 # If you have setup a configuration section, change the section tag to the following:
  {{{ 
  <section name="nhaml" type="NHaml.Configuration.NHamlSection, NHaml"/>
  }}}
 # In your actual section, rename it to "nhaml" and remove the "views" grouping tag.

Done!
