#summary How to get NHaml

There are several options for getting NHaml

==From the downloads page==

All documentation is based on the latest version

==Building from source==
This involves getting the latest source from [http://code.google.com/p/nhaml/source/checkout Googles subversion repository] and building it in Visual Studio 2008.

There is a good writeup on how to do this here

The latest build will be at this permalink

Not that these build, while passing all tests, may not be as stable as those taken from the Downloads page. They will however have all the latets bug fixes and features.
