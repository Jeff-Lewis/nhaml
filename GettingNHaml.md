There are several options for getting NHaml

## From the downloads page ##

http://code.google.com/p/nhaml/downloads/list

All documentation is based on the latest version

## Building from source ##
This involves getting the latest source from [Googles subversion repository](http://code.google.com/p/nhaml/source/checkout) and building it in Visual Studio 2008.

There is a good write up on how to do this here

## From the build server ##

The latest build will be at this permalink

http://teamcity.codebetter.com/viewLog.html?buildId=lastSuccessful&buildTypeId=bt43&tab=artifacts

Not that these builds, while passing all tests, may not be as stable as those taken from the Downloads page. They will however have all the latest bug fixes and features.
